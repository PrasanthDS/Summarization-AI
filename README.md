# Summarization AI: Build a Model to Summarize Dialogues

## Objective
- To develop an AI model that efficiently summarizes dialogues using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- To fine-tune transformer-based models for enhanced summarization capabilities.
- To evaluate model performance using relevant metrics to ensure high-quality summaries.
- To explore potential applications of summarization AI in various industries, such as customer support, media, and documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various dialogues and conversational data aimed at training and evaluating the summarization model. The dataset includes:
- Raw conversation transcripts
- Preprocessed text for model training
- Summary annotations for supervised learning

## Jupyter Notebooks
The Jupyter notebook **Summarization_AI.ipynb** provides the code, explanation, and implementation of:
- Data preprocessing and loading
- Model selection and fine-tuning
- Training process and evaluation metrics
- Summary generation and performance analysis

## Techniques Used
- **Few-shot Inference:** Leveraged pre-trained models with minimal labeled data to generate high-quality summaries.
- **Fine-tuned Model Performance:** Improved summary coherence and relevance through extensive training on domain-specific datasets.
- **Toxicity Reduction:** Applied filtering techniques and bias mitigation strategies to minimize harmful or biased outputs.

## Metrics Used
The performance of the summarization model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Measures overlap of words and phrases between generated and reference summaries.
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Evaluates n-gram precision to assess translation quality in summarization.
- **METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering):** Considers synonym matching and stemming for improved summary evaluation.
- **BERTScore:** Uses contextual embeddings from BERT to measure semantic similarity between summaries.
- **Toxicity Score:** Assessed using tools like **Perspective API** to ensure summaries are free from offensive or biased language.

## Conclusion
- The project successfully develops a dialogue summarization model capable of generating concise and meaningful summaries.
- **Few-shot inference** demonstrated better generalization with minimal labeled data, producing summaries comparable to human-generated ones.
- **Fine-tuned models** outperformed baseline transformer models in coherence, fluency, and informativeness.
- **Toxicity reduction techniques** significantly improved the modelâ€™s ability to generate unbiased and safe summaries.
- The potential applications of this model range from automating customer service interactions to improving content readability and efficiency.
- Future improvements may involve integrating reinforcement learning for enhanced summarization accuracy and multi-modal summarization approaches.

## Remarks
### Challenges:
- Handling long dialogues without losing contextual meaning.
- Evaluating summary quality using human and automated metrics.
- Optimizing model performance while maintaining efficiency.

### Future Enhancements:
- Experimenting with larger and more diverse datasets for improved generalization.
- Integrating user feedback mechanisms to refine generated summaries.
- Implementing domain-specific fine-tuning for customized summarization needs.

This project lays the foundation for effective dialogue summarization and can be extended to various real-world applications requiring automated text summarization.
